# CodeQ.GoogleDocs

Google Docs content node type for the Neos CMS.

This is a proof-of-concept implementation and therefore not yet perfect to be used for normal editors. To add content from Google Docs the editor needs to add the Google Docs FileID ( http://prntscr.com/hjdu82 ) manually in the backend. That file will render as HTML format.
